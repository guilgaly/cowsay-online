# cowsay-online

An implementation of cowsay as a webapp, because we all know that of course
everything is better in the Cloud :cloud:. Written in Scala with Akka-HTTP.

It aims to provide, in a single app:

- a webpage to manually generate cowsay outputs
- a RESTful API providing the same service
- Slack integration

Props to Tony Monroe for the original cowsay program.
